# meiose, a C++14 MessagePack (and JSON) de/serialization library

The core component of the library is the `meiose::variant`, a tagged union
container supporting the types of the MessagePack specification.

Use the `read` and `write` functions of the `msgpack` and `json` sub-namespaces
to read and write from and to `std::{i,o}stream`, respectively.

meiose does *not* support streamed/partial reading or writing of values, it can
only read them or write them all at once.

## Build systems

Multiple build system files are available for easy integration of the library
among other codebases. By default, all build system compiles meiose
*statically*

* CMake: **this is the main supported build system**.
  Exports the following library names:
  * `meiose-static` if `MEIOSE_BUILD_STATIC` is true (default).
  * `meiose` is `MEIOSE_BUILD_SHARED` is true.
* Meson: defines the following dependency variables:
  * `meiose_static` if option `static` is true (default).
  * `meiose` if option `shared` is true.
* QMake: always builds a `meiose` library. Static by default,
  unless `meiose-shared` `CONFIG` is set.
